## Introduction

This directory is dedicated to solving coding challenges using JavaScript. The solutions are designed to be clear, efficient, and well-documented, making them suitable for learning, interview preparation, or improving your problem-solving skills in JavaScript.

## Challenges

Below is a list of coding challenges included in this directory. Each challenge has its own folder containing the source code and a `README.md` file with detailed explanations.

### Easy

1. **Two Sum**
   - [Solution](TwoSum/)
   - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

2. **Palindrome Check**
   - [Solution](PalindromeCheck/)
   - Check if a given string is a palindrome.

3. **FizzBuzz**
   - [Solution](FizzBuzz/)
   - Print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz".

4. **Reverse String**
   - [Solution](ReverseString/)
   - Reverse a given string.

### Medium

1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - [Solution](LongestSubstringWithoutRepeating/)
   - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. **Valid Parentheses**
   - [Solution](ValidParentheses/)
   - Check if a string containing only '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']' is valid.

3. **Merge Intervals**
   - [Solution](MergeIntervals/)
   - Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

4. **Rotated Array Search**
   - [Solution](RotatedArraySearch/)
   - Search an element in a sorted array that has been rotated.

### Hard

1. **Trapping Rain Water**
   - [Solution](TrappingRainWater/)
   - Given an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

2. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays**
   - [Solution](MedianOfTwoSortedArrays/)
   - Find the median of two sorted arrays.

3. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**
   - [Solution](LargestRectangleHistogram/)
   - Find the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram.

4. **Sliding Window Maximum**
   - [Solution](SlidingWindowMaximum/)
   - Find the maximum in each sliding window of size k.
