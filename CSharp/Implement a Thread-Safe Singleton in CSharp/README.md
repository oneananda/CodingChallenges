# Implement a Thread-Safe Singleton in C#

## Implement a thread-safe Singleton class in C#. A Singleton class ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance. The challenge is to implement this pattern correctly in a multi-threaded environment, ensuring that only one instance is created even if multiple threads attempt to instantiate the Singleton simultaneously.
